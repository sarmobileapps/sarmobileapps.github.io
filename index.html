                    <p>A 'Twitter bot' is an account that is controlled by a bot, and a bot is an <strong>application
                            that executes an automated task.</strong></p>
                    <p>At its core, its function is to "tweet and retweet content for specific goals on a larger scale,"

                    <p>Bots either individually or in groups such as the <strong>botnet</strong>: “a broad network of
                        automated accounts that work together to appear legitimate, liking and following each other as
                        if they were real” (Norton).</p>
                    <p>But all malicious bots rely on <strong><em>stealth</em></strong>.</p>
                    <p>With stealth, bots try to persuade people into certain political beliefs with false information,
                        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl0TrA8oXXo">it has real world consequences on our

                    <p>There are a plethora of topics we could jump into, but to preface any conversation, here's a clip
                        of interviews of both Renée Diresta,
                        technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, and North Atlantic Treaty
                        Organization (NATO) Strategic Communications Center member,
                        Sebastian Bay. They discuss the selling of bots on the black market as well as the concepts of

                        and “meta” manipulation.</p>

                    <p>When we remember the COVID-19 pandemic of the abhorrent year that was 2020, there was lots being
                        said about the virus,
                        quarantine, and more online. But did we ever consider that perhaps more than half of the
                        accounts spreading
                        potentially false information were actually not human? According to researchers at Carnegie
                        Mellon University, of the <strong>200 million tweets</strong> they found discussing the virus
                        between January and May 2020,
                        <strong>45%</strong> were tweeted from accounts that were analyzed to be more <strong>bot-like
                            (A.K.A. automated)</strong> than human.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over 100 false narratives about COVID-19 were being disseminated on Twitter via bots. What were
                        these narratives? Tin-foil hat conspiracies like the 5G towers spreading corona,
                        hospitals being filled with mannequins, and similar brands of paranoid.</p>
                    <p>Insane? Yes. <em>But there are real world effects</em>:</p>

                            Unfortunately, Twitter bots are not an exception.</p>
                        <p>We mentioned “botnets” earlier, and they're not only great for misinformation in the

                        transaction with its dubious link, the bot deletes its own tweet.

                                the existence of bots.
                                If you ever see tweets that censor terms such as “commission,” “NFT,” “PayPal,”
                                and other often monetary/monetarily-related or inflammatory terms, it is likely censored
                                with the forward slash or numbers to avoid attracting bots.</p>

                            <p>But more positively speaking, there are plenty of fun and harmless bots for pop culture,
                                self-care, and other hobbies.
                                And Twitter does encourage what they believe to be bots that <a

                    <p style="margin-right: 0;">While bots do aim to be as human-like as possible, there are ways to
                        spot them. <a

                        gives us seven red flags:</p>
                    <!--left off at slide 13 ordered list-->
                    <ol class="xx">
                        <li>The potential Twitter bot shares the same IP adress as other potiential bots.</li>
                        <li>The timing of tweets is pretty close together.</li>
                        <li>Replies seem to be automatic.</li>
                        <li>Somehow, two things were tweeted at almost the same time.</li>
                        <li>The account is new.</li>
                        <li>The twitter handle contains numbers, and there's no profile picture (or there's a stolen
                            one.
                            Reverse image searching is recommended here).</li>
                        <li>It's retweeting and tweeting at an inhuman speed, and lacks followers but follows lots of
                            accounts.*</li>
                        <p style="font-size: 16px;">*It's worth noting that some bots manage to garner thousands of
                            followers
                            despite being bots, as some previous videos have illustrated.</p>

                                whether or not a Twitter account is a bot. These third-pary tools can help flag
                                suspicious accounts so you won't be fooled. Whether you use a third-party tool or learn
                                to recognize bots yourself, it's smart to <strong>understand how automated platforms can

                                <strong>skeptical</strong> about information contained in tweets. Go to reputable
